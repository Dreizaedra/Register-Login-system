A system I developped to work on my PHP skills and muscle memory,

Also one of my first real attempt at working with back-end and
    trying to have front & back communicate (through ajax here)
    
    
________________________________
Features :
- Register a new account (will not accept already used emails)
- Possibility to generate a random password (confirmation needed before register)
    through ajax/JS, also added an option to toggle the password fields visible
- Login with an Account page accessible once logged in
- Cookie system to automatically log the user in if he typed his ids at least 
    once before (thats when cookies are written if they dont already exist)
- Can change your password if forgotten or if logged in 
    through a secret question/answer system
